This is my mini Regular Expression Matcher.
It is written in the C programming language.
The only supported operators are:
#	//the escape character
?	// matches any (printable) character
*	// matches zero or more occurence of previouse character
.	// concatenation operator
|	//alternation operator
[]	// character classes like [0-9], [A-Z] etc
